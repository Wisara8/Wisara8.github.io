      <h2>William Samuel Randall</h2>
      <h3>Junior Web Developer</h3>
      <p>I am a former Mechanical Technologist turned Web Developer who enjoyed designing intricate air and fluid systems 
        within wineries and other buildings. I gained an interest in figuring out how the inner workings of the web apps 
        I was using to design worked and decided to take the leap into coding. I love seeing the big picture of how the 
        various parts of apps work and interact with each other and am eager to work and strengthen my fundamental knowledge.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h4>Market Buddy</h4>
      <p>Ever wonder if IGA is cheaper than Wholefoods? This app built for the Lighthouse Labs final project 
        allows users to create grocery lists online and search nearby stores to see the total grocery 
        list price broken down per store. A mobile companion app allows users to view their list and check off 
        items while shopping.
      </p>
      <p> This project utilizes: React, React Router, React Native, Node, Express, PSQL, Knex, and Materialize.</p>

      <h4>Quickadoo</h4>
      <p>A simple and fast Doodle clone. Web development students worked in groups of 3 to combine their front and back 
        and skills learned during the first half of the bootcamp to produce a web app from scratch. My contribution was 
        designing and maintaining the PSQL database and aiding in front end Javascript.
      </p>
      <p>This project utilizes HTML, CSS, JS, EJS, jQuery and AJAX on the front-end; as well as, 
        Node, Express, knex and PSQL on the back-end.
