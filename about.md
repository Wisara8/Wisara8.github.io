I am a former Mechanical Technologist turned Web Developer who enjoyed designing intricate air and fluid systems within wineries and other buildings. I gained an interest in figuring out how the inner workings of the web apps I was using to design worked and decided to take the leap into coding. I love seeing the big picture of how the various parts of apps work and interact with each other and am eager to work and strengthen my fundamental knowledge.
